**[How to simulate a deadlock](https://github.com/AnghelLeonard/Hibernate-SpringBoot/tree/master/HibernateSpringBootDeadlockExample)**
 
**Description:** This application is an example of causing a database deadlock in MySQL. This application produces an exception of type: `com.mysql.cj.jdbc.exceptions.MySQLTransactionRollbackException: Deadlock found when trying to get lock; try restarting transaction`. However, the database will retry until transaction (A) succeeds.

**Key points:**
- start *Transaction (A)* and trigger a `SELECT` with `PESSIMISTIC_WRITE` to acquire an exclusive lock to table `author`
- *Transaction (A)* update `author` genre with success and sleeps for 10s 
- after 5s, start a concurrent *Transaction B* that trigger a `SELECT` with `PESSIMISTIC_WRITE` to acquire an exclusive lock to table `book`
- *Transaction (B)* update `book` title with success and sleeps for 10s
- *Transaction (A)* wakes up and attempt to update the book but it cannot acquire the lock holded by *Transaction (B)*
- *Transaction (B)* wakes up and attempt to update the author but it cannot acquire the lock holded by *Transaction (A)*
- DEADLOCK
- database retry and succeeds after *Transaction (B)* releases the lock
